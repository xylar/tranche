# tranche

ConfigParser with layered precedence, provenance, comment-preserving writes,
and safe expressions.

The name **tranche** comes from the French word for *slice* â€” a nod to how the
library lets you cut cleanly through multiple configuration layers to get a
single, effective view of your settings.
